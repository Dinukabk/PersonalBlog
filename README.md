Adding Blog Posts:

Each file should be named according to the post title (e.g., my-first-post.md).
Frontmatter should be used to define the title, date, and other metadata.
Customizing the Website:

You can customize the site's colors, fonts, and layout by editing the src/styles directory.
Update the src/config.js file to change global settings like site title, description, and author information.
